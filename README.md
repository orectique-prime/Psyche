# Psyche
Psyche is a chatbot hosted on IBM Watson/IBM Cloud designed to help bring depressed persons out of the next they create for themselves.
Right now, the chatbot can be accessed as an android app, which is in its early days of development. The app has been released here, in github, instead of the traditional Play Store because of the 2-3 day verification time required. It will be available on the Play Store as soon as possible.
